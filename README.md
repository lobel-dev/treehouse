<h3 align="center">Manage worktrees without managing worktrees.</h3>

Are you still only working on one task at a time? Are you manually juggling between a few clones of the same repo?

Or... are you starting a new worktree for every agent session, losing all your installed dependencies and build cache each time, and wondering why your agents are slow?

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunchenguid/treehouse/main/demo.gif" alt="treehouse demo" width="800" />
</p>

Treehouse helps you manage a pool of reusable, isolated worktrees so each of your agents gets its own environment instantly - no cloning, no conflicts, no coordination overhead.

- **Instant isolation** - `treehouse` puts you into a clean worktree with zero hassel.
- **Reusable worktrees** - worktrees are preserved in a pool when you're done, with dependencies and build cache intact, ready for the next agent.
- **Conflict-free** - automatic detection of in-use worktrees and your agents never step on each other's toes.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ cd myproject                 # start in your repo as usual
$ treehouse                    # get a worktree and drop into a subshell
🌳 Entered worktree at ~/.treehouse/myproject-a1b2c3/1/myproject. Type 'exit' to return.

# You're now in an isolated worktree.
# Run your AI agent, make changes, do whatever you need.

$ exit                         # exit the subshell when you're done
🌳 Terminated lingering processes: opencode (pid 12345)
🌳 Worktree returned to pool.
```

## How It Works

Treehouse manages a **pool of git worktrees** per repository, stored under the configured treehouse root.
The default treehouse root is `~/.treehouse/`.
You can instead keep the pool [inside the project](#in-project-storage) with `--root .`, so it lives next to the code and is removed with the project.

```

```

- **Detached HEAD** - worktrees use detached HEAD mode, reset to whichever of the local or remote default branch is further ahead, avoiding branch name conflicts entirely.
- **Choosable base branch** - set `base_branch` in `treehouse.toml`, or pass `treehouse get --base <branch>`, to cut worktrees from a branch other than the repository default. Opt-in; unset keeps today's inference. Worktrees stay in detached HEAD - this selects the commit they start at, it does not create or check out a branch.
- **No daemon** - all operations are inline CLI commands.
  Pool state is a small on-disk file, written under a lock by each command.
- **Interactive shell setup** - when opening a subshell on macOS or Linux, `treehouse`, `treehouse get`, and `treehouse enter` start `$SHELL` as an interactive login shell when it resolves to `bash`, `fish`, or `zsh`. Other shells, fallback shells, and Windows use their default invocation. A regular executable that is merely named like a supported shell but does not accept `-i -l` (for example a wrapper script at `/opt/tools/bash`) is an accepted limitation: the resolved basename is the contract, and PATH-identity probing would reject genuine second installs of the same shell.
- **In-use detection** - treehouse scans running processes and short-lived owner reservations to determine which worktrees are in-use. Reservations are persisted only while `get`, `destroy`, and `prune` lifecycle work is running.
- **Durable leases** - `treehouse get --lease` reserves a worktree as a persistent home without keeping a process inside it. Each acquisition gets an immutable random lease identity, and the lease is recorded in treehouse's own state. The worktree is never handed out by a later `get` and never removed by `prune` until you release it with `treehouse return`. Unlike process-based in-use detection, a lease survives with zero processes running inside the worktree.
- **State recovery** - treehouse writes pool state atomically via a temp file and replacement.
  If an existing state file is empty, truncated, or omits an on-disk worktree, treehouse rebuilds the missing entries and quarantines them for inspection and explicit destruction. See [Recovering missing pool state](#recovering-missing-pool-state).
- **Gitignored file seeding** - commit a `.worktreeinclude` file for the default selection, or pass `get --include-file <path>` for a personal manifest. Selected local files are copied from the main checkout on each acquire. See [Seeding gitignored files](#seeding-gitignored-files).
- **Dirty detection** - treehouse treats tracked changes and untracked files as dirty, even when repository config hides untracked files from normal `git status` output.
- **Safe pruning** - By default, `treehouse prune` removes only idle managed worktrees whose HEAD is already merged into the default branch and whose working tree is clean.
  `treehouse prune --all` applies the same safety checks across every managed pool under the user-level treehouse root.
  Backing-repository-missing orphans are reported by default; `--prune-orphans` includes them as unverified prune candidates, and `--yes` is required before deletion.
  It is a dry run unless you pass `--yes`.
- **Self-healing get** - `treehouse get` prunes stale git worktree bookkeeping (e.g. left behind by a crashed or forcibly removed worktree) before adding a new worktree, so a prunable registration never wedges the pool with a "missing but already registered worktree" error.

## CLI Reference

| Command                    | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `treehouse`                | Get a worktree and open a subshell (alias for `get`) |
| `treehouse get`            | Acquire a worktree from the pool                     |
| `treehouse get --lease`    | Durably lease a worktree without a subshell; print its path |
| `treehouse lease <name>`   | Durably lease an existing pool worktree in place, without touching its files or git state |
| `treehouse enter <name\|pool/name>` | Open a subshell in an existing worktree by name (the number from `status`), even if it is in use; pool state is left untouched. A `pool/name` selector works from any directory |
| `treehouse status`         | Show pool status (highlights leased and current worktrees) |
| `treehouse return [path]`  | Release any lease and return a worktree only after verifying foreign processes stopped |
| `treehouse prune`          | Dry-run removal of stale idle worktrees in the current repo pool |
| `treehouse prune --all`    | Dry-run removal of stale idle worktrees across every managed pool |
| `treehouse destroy <path>` | Dry-run removal of one worktree (safe by default; `--yes` to execute) |
| `treehouse destroy <pool> --all` | Dry-run removal of every disposable worktree in that pool |
| `treehouse init`           | Create a default `treehouse.toml` config file        |
| `treehouse update`         | Update treehouse to the latest version               |

### Navigation across projects

Run `treehouse status --all` (or `--global`) from any directory to list worktrees across projects. Each row starts with a copyable `pool/name` selector; the pool directory name includes the repository identity, so projects with the same basename remain distinct.

```sh
treehouse status --all
treehouse enter same-0a8cbd/1
cd "$(treehouse enter --print-path same-0a8cbd/1)"
```

Use the selector printed by your listing. Qualified `enter` opens that existing slot without acquiring, resetting, returning, or writing pool state. Exiting leaves its files and lease intact. Local `treehouse status` and `treehouse enter 1` still select the current repository.

Global navigation searches only managed pool directories immediately under the user-level root, using user config or an absolute `--root` override. It does not discover repo-relative roots or other custom roots automatically; pass their absolute root explicitly. An empty root lists no worktrees and is not created. Relative roots are rejected for global navigation.

`treehouse status --all --json` stays a top-level array with the usual status fields plus `pool` (the pool directory name) and `selector` on each row. Local status JSON is unchanged. Global status reads a snapshot without healing or writing pool state.

A pool that cannot be read (for example one written by a newer treehouse) never hides the others: worktrees from healthy pools are still listed on stdout, the unreadable pool is named on stderr, and the command exits non-zero to flag that the listing is incomplete.

### Flags

| Command   | Flag      | Description                       |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `get`     | `--lease` | Durably lease the worktree without opening a subshell; print only its path to stdout |
| `get`     | `--lease-holder` | Optional label recorded as the lease holder (defaults to `$TREEHOUSE_LEASE_HOLDER`) |
| `get`     | `--json` | Print `path`, `lease_id`, `lease_holder`, `leased_at`, and `base_branch` as JSON (requires `--lease`) |

| `lease`   | `--json` | Print `path`, `lease_id`, `lease_holder`, `leased_at`, and `base_branch` as JSON (`base_branch` is best-effort: empty when the slot records no explicit base and its own worktree cannot resolve a default) |

| `prune`   | `--verbose`, `-v` | Show detailed skip diagnostics |
| `destroy` | `--all`   | Remove all worktrees in the named pool (requires a pool path) |
| `destroy` | `--yes`   | Execute the removal instead of doing a dry run |
| `destroy` | `--include-unlanded` | Also remove dirty, unmerged, or unverified worktrees (irreversible data loss) |
| `destroy` | `--include-in-use` | Also remove worktrees with a running process or owner reservation (processes are terminated cleanly first) |
| `destroy` | `--include-leased` | Also remove a leased worktree; only when the exact path is named, never via `--all` |

### Seeding gitignored files

Commit a `.worktreeinclude` file to seed selected gitignored files from the main checkout into each acquired Git worktree or jj workspace. This is useful for local configuration or generated files that every worktree needs but Git should not track. By default, only the committed file at the worktree's HEAD is used; a dirty or untracked `.worktreeinclude` in the main checkout is ignored, and a missing committed file is a no-op.

Manifests use `.gitignore` pattern syntax. A file must be ignored by the repository and selected by the manifest; tracked files and unignored untracked files are never copied. Use `!` to exclude a broader match:

```gitignore
.env*
!.env.local
local-config/
```

For a personal selection that does not need to be committed, pass an explicit manifest:

```sh
treehouse get --include-file ./personal.include
treehouse get --lease --include-file ./personal.include
```

The supplied manifest **replaces**, rather than extends, committed `.worktreeinclude` for this acquisition, on both new and reused slots. The manifest may be tracked, untracked, or ignored. Relative manifest paths resolve from your current directory; patterns inside the file always select files relative to the main checkout root, not the manifest's directory. There is no config setting or environment variable for this override.

Treehouse reads the supplied file once before acquisition. A missing or unreadable file is an error before any slot is created or reset, with no fallback to the committed manifest. An empty file seeds nothing. Later acquisitions without the flag use the committed default again. Return and reuse remove previously seeded files using Treehouse's recorded inventory, even if the local manifest has changed or been deleted.

Treehouse refreshes selected files whenever it creates or reuses a worktree. On Unix-like systems, it preserves regular-file permissions, including executable bits. A source symlink becomes a regular file containing the symlink target text; Treehouse never follows it or creates a destination symlink. Rooted filesystem operations prevent selected paths and existing destination symlinks from escaping either checkout.

If seeding fails, acquisition fails too. A newly created worktree is removed; if cleanup fails, or if a reused worktree was only partly refreshed, Treehouse records it as leased and quarantined so a later `get` cannot hand it out silently. Inspect it with `treehouse status`. If Treehouse reports that its seeded-file inventory is unknown, remove it with `treehouse destroy <path> --include-leased --yes`; `treehouse return` refuses to reuse it. Other quarantined worktrees can be returned after they are safe to reuse.

### Leasing a worktree (no subshell)

`treehouse get` normally opens an interactive subshell whose lifetime is the hold: when the shell exits, the worktree returns to the pool.
That is awkward for callers that need a worktree to persist as a permanent home with no long-lived process inside it.

`treehouse get --lease` is the non-interactive, durable alternative:

```sh
path=$(treehouse get --lease)
# $path is the leased worktree's absolute path; all banners went to stderr.
```

It acquires a worktree exactly like `get`, but instead of opening a subshell it marks the worktree **leased** in treehouse's persistent state. By default it prints only the worktree's absolute path to stdout; `--json` prints the lease allocation instead. Every human-facing message goes to stderr, so either output mode stays clean.

A leased worktree is never handed out by a later `get` and never removed by `prune`, regardless of whether any process runs inside it, until the lease is explicitly released.
A bulk `treehouse destroy <pool> --all` never removes it either; only naming its exact path with `treehouse destroy <path> --include-leased --yes` will.

Pass `--lease-holder <label>` (or set `$TREEHOUSE_LEASE_HOLDER`) to record who holds the lease; `treehouse status` then shows it next to the `leased` state.

`get --lease` can only protect a worktree it acquires itself. To give a worktree that already exists - a long-lived home acquired with plain `get`, or any registered slot that predates leases - the same protection after the fact, lease it in place:

```sh
treehouse lease 3 --lease-holder secondmate-home
```

`lease` is state-only: it never resets, fetches, cleans, or checks out the worktree, so it is safe on a slot holding live work. It refuses when the name is unknown, when the registered worktree's directory no longer exists, when the slot is being destroyed, or when it is already leased (naming the holder). Leasing a worktree whose `treehouse get` shell is still running is safe: when that shell exits, `get` sees the slot is no longer its own and leaves it untouched. `treehouse return <path>` releases an in-place lease exactly like an acquired one.

Every acquisition receives a new random `lease_id`, including reacquiring the same path with the same holder. Automation can request a stable machine-readable allocation:

```sh
treehouse get --lease --lease-holder automation-A --json
# {"path":"...","lease_id":"...","lease_holder":"automation-A","leased_at":"...","base_branch":"main"}
```

Callers that already fetched the required refs can avoid another network operation with `--no-fetch`:

```sh
git fetch origin main refs/pull/123/head
treehouse get --lease --no-fetch --json
```

With `--no-fetch`, Treehouse resets or creates the worktree from existing local refs and never contacts `origin`. The caller is responsible for ensuring those refs and objects are current.

`treehouse status --json` returns an array with `name`, `path`, `status`, `flavor`, `lease_id`, `lease_holder`, `leased_at`, and `processes`. `flavor` is the backend the worktree's own marker identifies (`"git"` or `"jj"`) and is omitted when no marker is found. Non-leased entries use empty lease strings and a `null` timestamp. State files written before lease identities remain readable; their existing leases have an empty `lease_id` until released and acquired again.

Release a lease with `treehouse return <path>`, which terminates lingering processes and verifies that no foreign process remains before it resets the worktree, clears the lease, and returns the worktree to the pool.
If process termination or that verification fails, the command exits nonzero and leaves the worktree and lease in place instead of recycling a slot that may still be in use.
An aborted return exits nonzero. A non-interactive dirty return aborts without cleaning: prune will not reclaim that slot. Retry by pasting the printed `treehouse return --force <quoted-path>` hint (shell-quoted so copy-paste does not expand metacharacters). `--force` with no path only works from inside a repository.

For Git worktrees, both explicit return (including `--force`) and automatic return on subshell exit refuse to reset HEAD unless a local branch, tag, or remote-tracking ref preserves its commits. Unmerged branch-backed work can still be returned. Preservation is checked against stored commit ancestry, ignoring replacement objects and legacy grafts. Detached commits protected only by a reflog or another worktree's HEAD must first be saved, for example with `git branch saved-work HEAD` inside the worktree. The initial commit-preservation checks happen before process termination; a refusal there preserves HEAD, files, and the reservation. Later preparation or reset failures retain the reservation, but processes may already have stopped. Return pins Git commands to the slot's verified Git directory and worktree so a changed or missing marker cannot redirect cleanup into another checkout. `--force` permits dirty-file cleanup; it does not bypass commit preservation. Git repositories using reftable ref storage are refused because return requires files-based ref locking. The opt-in jj backend retains its existing reset behavior.

When you pass an explicit path, `treehouse return` can run from outside the repository because it resolves the managed pool from that worktree path.

For retry-safe automation, condition the return on the identity from allocation or status:

```sh
treehouse return --force \
  --if-lease-id "$lease_id" \
  --if-lease-holder "$lease_holder" \
  "$path"
```

Treehouse compares supplied conditions while holding the pool state lock. A missing lease or mismatch exits nonzero before process termination, worktree reset, or state clearing. The same lock fences a matching return through the final clear, so the identity succeeds once and cannot release a later acquisition of the same path. `--if-lease-holder` is optional; use `--if-lease-id` for ABA protection when a holder may be reused.

For backward compatibility, `treehouse return <path>` without either condition keeps its original unconditional path-only behavior. Existing path-only scripts and `treehouse get --lease` stdout are unchanged.

### Recovering missing pool state

Treehouse writes `treehouse-state.json` atomically, so a crash mid-write should leave the previous state file intact.
If an existing state file is empty, truncated, or otherwise invalid, commands do not fail just because the JSON cannot be parsed.
They print a warning and rebuild the pool entries from worktree directories still on disk.
Commands also restore an on-disk worktree that is missing from an otherwise valid state file, covering the narrow case where worktree creation succeeded but recording its quarantine failed.
Every restored entry is marked `leased` because treehouse cannot know whether it was idle, in-use, or durably leased.

Run `treehouse status` to inspect recovered entries.
Treehouse cannot safely return these entries to the pool because recovery cannot reconstruct the trusted inventory of seeded ignored files.
State written by versions without inventory integrity data, or whose pool-local `treehouse-state.key` is missing or invalid, is handled the same way, including state rewritten after a downgrade.
After inspecting a recovered worktree, remove it by naming its exact path with `treehouse destroy <path> --include-leased --yes`.
Bulk `destroy --all` and prune leave recovered entries alone.

### Pruning stale worktrees and orphans

`treehouse prune` is a dry run by default.
By default, it lists stale idle managed worktrees that would be deleted and shows the reclaimable disk space.
Pass `treehouse prune --yes` to delete those worktrees.

By default, prune only inspects the current repository's pool and must be run inside a repository.
Pass `treehouse prune --all` or `treehouse prune --global` to inspect every managed pool under the user-level treehouse root from any directory.
Global prune reads the user-level config and hooks, derives each worktree's owning repository from version-control metadata, then fetches and checks merge safety against that repository.
Without `--prune-orphans`, pass `treehouse prune --all --yes` to delete only the globally safe stale candidates.

Prune ignores worktrees that are currently in use, leased, or reserved by another lifecycle operation.
It skips idle worktrees that are unsafe to remove and prints the skip reason, such as uncommitted tracked or untracked changes, or a HEAD commit that is not merged into the default branch.
Skip output is grouped by reason so large global sweeps stay scannable.
When `origin` exists, prune fetches it and proves each HEAD against the current remote default branch tracking ref.
Without `origin`, prune uses the local default branch ref.
If `origin` cannot be reached, prune reports `origin unreachable (cannot verify)` and leaves the worktree untouched, even when `--prune-orphans` is set.
If a linked worktree points at a missing backing repository, prune reports `orphaned (backing repository missing)`.
Plain `treehouse prune` and `treehouse prune --all` never delete those orphans.
Pass `--prune-orphans` to include true backing-repository-missing orphans in the dry run, then add `--yes` to delete them.
Treehouse cannot verify orphan contents after the backing version-control metadata is gone, so each orphan candidate is marked `content could not be verified`.
Use `--verbose` to show the underlying version-control diagnostic details for skipped worktrees.

### Destroying worktrees

`treehouse destroy` is the deliberate tool for removing a worktree even though it still has unlanded work, but it is safe by default and holds itself to the same bar as `prune`.

Targets are narrow and explicit:

- `treehouse destroy <worktree-path>` targets exactly one worktree.
- `treehouse destroy <pool-path> --all` targets worktrees in THAT pool only. The pool path can be the pool directory, a worktree inside it, or the repository (`.` works from inside a repo).

There is no cross-pool or global destroy: `--all` without a pool path is an error, so a stray command can never reach beyond the pool you named.

Destroy is a dry run by default.
It prints a risk-revealing preview - one or more status labels (`[disposable]`, `[leased]`, `[in-use:<pid>]`, `[unmerged]`, `[dirty]`, `[unverified]`, or a comma-separated combination such as `[leased,dirty]`), the path, and the size of each target - and removes nothing.
Pass `--yes` to execute.
It never prints a blind "all worktrees destroyed"; the summary always reports exactly what was destroyed and what was skipped.

A bare `treehouse destroy <pool> --all --yes` removes only the genuinely disposable set (merged, clean, idle, unleased - the same set `prune` would take) and SKIPS everything else, telling you which flag would include it.
Each risky class is its own opt-in, so removing risky worktrees can never be a reflexive `--yes`:

- `--include-unlanded` also removes worktrees with uncommitted changes, a HEAD not merged into the default branch, or contents treehouse cannot verify, such as a missing backing repository (irreversible data loss).
- `--include-in-use` also removes worktrees with a running process or owner reservation; their processes are terminated cleanly first and their pids are shown in the preview.
- `--include-leased` also removes a leased worktree, but only when you name the exact worktree path. Leased worktrees are NEVER removed by `--all`; combining `--include-leased` with `--all` is rejected.

A single named worktree that is skipped for lack of a flag makes the command exit non-zero, so scripts notice that nothing happened.
Bulk `--all` skips are normal and exit zero; inspect the summary to see what remains.

#### Migrating from `--force`

The old blunt `treehouse destroy --force` flag has been removed.
It overrode every protection at once - in-use, unmerged, dirty, and leased - which is what made it dangerous.
Replace it with the specific `--include-*` flag(s) for the risk you actually intend to override, plus `--yes`:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| `treehouse destroy <path> --force` | `treehouse destroy <path> --yes` (add `--include-unlanded` / `--include-in-use` / `--include-leased` as needed) |
| `treehouse destroy --all --force` | `treehouse destroy <pool> --all --yes` (add `--include-unlanded` for dirty, unmerged, or unverified targets, and `--include-in-use` for in-use targets; leased homes are never included) |

## Configuration

Create a repo config file with `treehouse init`, or add one manually:

**Repo-level:** `treehouse.toml` in the repository root

**User-level:** `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`

```toml
# Maximum number of worktrees in the pool
max_trees = 16

# Optional worktree root directory.
# Empty uses $HOME/.treehouse.
# Relative paths are resolved from the repo root for repo-scoped commands.
# Use "." to keep the pool inside the project (see "In-project storage" below).
# Use an absolute user-level root for treehouse prune --all.
# root = "$HOME/worktrees"

# Optional base branch worktrees are cut from.

The repo-level config takes precedence for repo-safe settings.
Global commands (`treehouse prune --all`, `treehouse status --all`, and a qualified `treehouse enter <pool>/<name>`) can run without a repository, so they use only the user-level config and never read per-repo `treehouse.toml` files.
If no config is found, the default pool size is 16.

### Base branch

By default Treehouse infers the branch worktrees are cut from: `origin/HEAD`, then the checked-out branch, then `init.defaultBranch`.
That inference is invisible and can drift - `origin/HEAD` is only set at clone time, and some clones never have it at all.

Set it explicitly for the whole pool:

```toml
base_branch = "develop"
```

or for a single acquisition:

```sh
treehouse get --base develop
treehouse get --lease --base release/2.x --json
```

`--base` wins over `base_branch`, and both are opt-in: with neither set, the inference is unchanged.

A few things worth knowing:

- **Worktrees stay in detached HEAD.** This selects the commit a worktree starts at; it does not create or check out a branch. There is no `-b` shorthand, because `-b` means branch *creation* in git and this flag creates nothing.
- **Branch names only.** `develop`, not `origin/develop`, a tag, or a commit SHA. Whichever of `develop` and `origin/develop` is further ahead wins, preferring `origin` when they have diverged - exactly how the inferred default behaves. A tag sharing a branch's name never wins: refs are resolved fully qualified.
- **It fails closed.** A base that resolves to neither a local branch nor `origin/<branch>` is an error; Treehouse never falls back to the inferred default, which would hand you a worktree cut from the wrong branch and report success. `treehouse status` shows the resolved base, and flags a configured one it cannot resolve.
- **Returned worktrees are parked on the base they were cut from**, so the pool keeps recycling. `base_branch` wins when it is set; otherwise a slot acquired with `--base` is parked back on that branch. A slot parked elsewhere could not be reused whenever the base is not a descendant of it.
- **Existing pools migrate on their own.** A slot is recycled onto a newly requested base as long as it carries nothing beyond the base it was cut from; the two bases need no ancestry relation, so a `develop` slot rejoins a plain `treehouse get` and vice versa. A slot holding commits the new base does not contain is still refused, as always.
- **Git backend only for now.** Under the jj backend an explicit base fails with a clear error rather than silently using the default bookmark.

### Version-control backend (git or Jujutsu)

Treehouse works in git and [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) repositories.
**The jj backend is experimental**: it is newer than the git backend and has seen far less production use, so treat it accordingly and report issues.
In a jj repository, pooled worktrees are [jj workspaces](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/#workspaces) instead of git worktrees; the pool, lease, and safety machinery is identical.

Git is the default backend everywhere, including in colocated repositories (both `.jj` and `.git`) and `.jj`-only repositories.
Opt in to the jj backend with `vcs = "jj"`, resolved in this precedence (highest first): the `TREEHOUSE_VCS` environment variable, the repo-level `treehouse.toml`, the user-level `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`.
The jj opt-in only applies where a `.jj` directory actually exists; in a plain git repository it is silently ignored and git is used, so a shell-wide `TREEHOUSE_VCS=jj` never breaks git-only repositories.
A `vcs` value other than `"git"` or `"jj"` (e.g. `"Jujutsu"`) is ignored the same way, but warns once on stderr naming the value and where it came from, so a typo keeps commands working without silently leaving you on the wrong backend.
Pooled jj workspaces inherit the opt-in from their main repository root, so an untracked `treehouse.toml` there is enough.

The backend is resolved on every command, and existing pool slots keep the flavor they were created with: changing the opt-in does not convert worktrees already in the pool.
`destroy` and `prune` handle each slot by its own flavor (its `.git` or `.jj` marker), so a git worktree is still cleanly deregistered from git even after opting the repository into jj, and vice versa.
A slot whose marker is missing entirely (a damaged slot) is never reused, reset, or detached; `treehouse status` reports it as `damaged`, `treehouse return` only clears its lease, `treehouse lease` still protects it but reports an empty `base_branch` rather than reading one through a fallback backend, `prune` reports it as unverifiable, and `treehouse destroy <path> --include-unlanded` removes it.
`treehouse get` is flavor-aware too: it only reuses slots matching the backend the repository currently selects, and creates new slots with that backend, so a caller who opted in to jj is never handed a git worktree (or vice versa).
Old-flavor slots stay in the pool untouched - `treehouse status` marks them and they count toward `max_trees` - until you migrate them: `treehouse destroy` the old slots and re-acquire with `treehouse get`.

jj-backend notes:

- Pooled worktrees are jj workspaces and are not colocated: they contain `.jj` but no `.git`, so run jj commands (not git) inside them.
- A worktree is considered dirty when its working-copy commit `@` is non-empty or has a description.
- Resets abandon only the working-copy commit and are recoverable with `jj op restore`.
- Merge detection uses ancestry; squash-merged work is treated as unmerged, so lifecycle commands err on the side of keeping it.
- The default branch resolves to the `main`/`master`/`trunk` bookmark, preferring origin.
- A pooled jj workspace whose backing repository was deleted is classified as an orphan just like a git worktree: `prune` reports it, and `prune --prune-orphans --yes` reclaims it.

### Worktree root

The worktree root can also be set without a config file, and the resolved value follows this precedence (highest first):

1. The `--root` flag (e.g. `treehouse get --root .`)
2. The `TREEHOUSE_ROOT` environment variable
3. `root` in the repo-level `treehouse.toml`
4. `root` in the user-level `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`
5. The default, `~/.treehouse`

A relative value (including `.`) is resolved from the repo root, exactly like a relative `root` in config; `treehouse` is always appended, so `--root .` places the pool at `<repo>/.treehouse/`.

### In-project storage

By default the pool lives in the global `~/.treehouse` store. Set the root to `.` to keep it **inside the project** instead:

```sh
treehouse get --root .          # one-off
export TREEHOUSE_ROOT=.         # for a shell session
```

or commit it for the whole repo in `treehouse.toml`:

```toml
root = "."
```

This is **opt-in**; the default global store is unchanged. In-project mode:

- Places the pool at `<repo>/.treehouse/`, so worktrees sit next to the code and are **removed with the project** (`rm -rf <repo>` leaves no global orphan).
- Git-ignores the pool directory automatically, so it stays out of `git add`.
- Is not discovered automatically by global commands such as `treehouse prune --all` and `treehouse status --all`, which default to the user-level root. To target the in-project pool, pass the repository's absolute path with `--root` (for example, `treehouse status --all --root /path/to/repo`).

### Hooks

You can run commands automatically at worktree lifecycle points by adding a `[hooks]` section to the user-level config at `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`.
Hooks in repo-level `treehouse.toml` are ignored for safety.
`treehouse destroy` always reads `pre_destroy` from the user-level config because it can target a pool by path.

```toml
[hooks]
post_create = ["./scripts/setup-venv.sh"]
pre_destroy = ["./scripts/teardown.sh"]
```

- `post_create` runs after a worktree is provisioned or reset and right before `treehouse get` hands it to you.
  For `treehouse get --lease`, stdout from `post_create` is routed to stderr so stdout remains the leased path.
- `pre_destroy` runs before a worktree is removed by `treehouse destroy <path> --yes`, `treehouse destroy <pool> --all --yes`, or prune deletion commands such as `treehouse prune --yes` and `treehouse prune --prune-orphans --yes`.

Commands in each list run sequentially in the worktree directory, via the OS shell (`/bin/sh -c` on Linux/macOS, `%COMSPEC% /c` on Windows).
If a command exits non-zero, treehouse logs the command, exit code, and stderr, then continues with the remaining commands.
A failing hook does not fail the overall `get`, `destroy`, or `prune` operation.
